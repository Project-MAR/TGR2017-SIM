### 03-STM32L053-IOTClient   

 This folder contain template code and project workspace for STM32L053R8 Nucleo Board. This is a hardest part (I think) because I try to use Eclipse + GCC + OpenOCD to build the system. If you dont't want to go deeper, you can use [SW4STM32](http://www.openstm32.org/HomePage) (System Workbench for STM32) instead. It also an Eclipse + GCC + OpenOCD base, ready to use, development platform for STM32.
